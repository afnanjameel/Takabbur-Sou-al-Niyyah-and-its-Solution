    <h1>Takabbur, Sou' al-Niyyah and its Solution</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>To understand this article, three things must be believed first:</p>

    <h3>1. The Day of Judgment (Youm al-Akhira)</h3>
    <p>A day will come when Allah will resurrect everyone, question them about their deeds, and reward or punish them accordingly.</p>

    <h3>2. Every worldly thing belongs Allah</h3>
    <p>Humans can't possess anything in this world for eternity</p>

    <h3>3. No human can benefit or harm another</h3>
    <p>Only Allah has the power to bring benefit or harm.</p>

    <h2>Definition of Takabbur (Arrogance)</h2>
    <p>Takabbur is something that exists in almost all of us today. First, let’s understand what arrogance means. It is often interpreted as someone with wealth, power, or influence considering others to be inferior. However, the meaning is broader than this.</p>

    <h3>Some aspects that we tend to overlook include:</h3>
    <p>If someone possesses knowledge and speaks about it in a gathering, thinking they are superior to others because of it, and believes that their knowledge is due to their own intellect while others are less intelligent, this is takabbur. Even if they don’t say it out loud, having this thought in their heart is enough to be considered arrogance. Such feelings can even arise in righteous people because they are whispers from Satan.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if someone performs good deeds and considers others inferior because they do not do as much, even if they do not express it verbally but merely think it in their heart, this is takabbur.</p>

    <h2> Sou' al-Niyyah (Insincerity of Intention)</h2>
    <p>We will discuss other things later, but first, let’s talk about arrogance in deeds. When a person becomes arrogant about their good deeds, thinking they are superior to others because of their actions, a new problem arises: the sincerity of intention. At that point, you are no longer performing the deed for Allah, but for people, so they see and praise you. There is a hadith related to this, that such a person (who lacks Ikhlas al-Niyyah will be thrown into Hell by Allah.</p>

    <p>And this is something worth reflecting on—if you are doing something, what is there to be proud of? If you are performing any deed, the most you are doing is using the blessings that Allah has given you according to His instructions. In doing so, you are not doing a favor to Allah or to any human being.</p>

    <h2>Solution (Submission to Allah SWT)</h2>
    <p>Now, let’s discuss other matters, which will also bring solution to the issues mentioned above.</p>
    <p>To protect yourself from these things, you must develop a psychology that whatever you are doing is not because of you, but because of Allah’s permission. You must understand that if you have power, influence, or wealth, it is not due to your own merit, but rather a gift from Allah. If you have knowledge, it is because Allah SWT has given it to you. Let me explain:</p>

    <p>All the things mentioned—power, knowledge, wealth—are Allah’s commands. Power belongs to Allah (Al-Qadeer), knowledge belongs to Allah (Al-Aleem), wealth belongs to Allah (Ar-Razzaq). These are Allah’s commands. Your speech is by Allah’s command, your vision is by Allah’s command. No human has given you these things. Even if wealth comes through inheritance, it was given to your father by Allah, and then it reached you. Influence is also not due to your father’s actions but was given to him by Allah. Same goes for beauty as well. If you have good fashion sense and styling technique, that's not because of you. That's also from Allah SWT.</p>

    <p>The ability to think has been given to you by Allah. Even the clothes you wear have been given to you by Allah. If someone wears worse clothes than you, those too were given to them by Allah. If someone has less intellect than you, that too was given to them by Allah. Your house, your car—all were given to you by Allah SWT. The only thing that truly belongs to you in this world is your shroud (Kafan). The proof of this is that when you die, your car or house does not go into the grave with you.</p>

    <p>These things are entrusted to humans by Allah SWT. Humans achieve higher status because of them, and then they become arrogant.</p>

    <p>You need to understand that whatever deed you perform, you do so by Allah’s permission, whether it is good or bad. The difference is that in good deeds, Allah’s pleasure is involved, and in bad deeds, it is not. But permission is required in both. This is the test Allah has placed upon humans: He has given you permission to act according to your will in this world. Whether you follow or disobey, you are doing it only with His permission. You have no power of your own in this. And the reward or punishment for all this will be given to you in the Hereafter.</p>

    <p>This also makes it clear that if you possess influence, knowledge, or wealth, you will be questioned about it in the Hereafter. Allah SWT will ask you how you used the power He gave you. Therefore, the wealth given by Allah should be spent on the right path, the knowledge given by Allah should be shared, and whatever deed you do should be done sincerely for Allah, avoiding arrogance.</p>

    <p>May Allah guide us all!</p>
